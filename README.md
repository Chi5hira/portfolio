# About Me
A Software Engineering graduate on a mission to explore the realms of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX). I embarked on this journey as a UI/UX Designer in 2020, concurrently with the start of my studies in Software Engineering. I have grown and developed through various UI/UX design explorations, including competition projects, coursework assessments, and business projects. Each exploration has been a learning experience, encompassing tools such as Figma, Miro, Maze, InkView, and Affinity Designer, as well as design methods and thinking approaches like atomic design and design thinking. It has also highlighted the necessity for intelligence and innovation to adapt to various challenges. I continue my journey as a UI/UX Design explorer even after completing my undergraduate studies in software engineering, which spanned 4 years and 8 semesters, with a GPA of 3.97. Barakallahu.
